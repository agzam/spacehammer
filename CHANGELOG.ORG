    - Addressed workaround for regression in fennel 0.4.0 https://github.com/bakpakin/Fennel/issues/276
  - [2020-02-23 Sun]
    - Move to display feature. Windows modal: <LEAD w> now would display a big
      number at the corner of each display, when a number on the keypad is
      pressed, current active app window will be moved onto that screen. Useful
      for multi-monitor setups.

      Note: if ~/.spacehammer/config.fnl is used, it
      needs to be updated in order for this feature to work.
