(fn when-let
  [[var-name value] body1 ...]
  "
  Macro to set a local value and perform the body when the local value is truthy
  Takes a vector to assign a local var to a value and any number of body forms
  Returns the return value of the last body form executed

  Example:
  (when-let [x true]
    (hs.alert \"x is true\")
    \"hello world\")
  ;; => \"hello world\"
  "
  (assert body1 "expected body")
  `(let [,var-name ,value]
     (when ,var-name
       ,body1 ,...)))

(fn if-let
  [[var-name value] body1 ...]
  "
  Macro to set a local value and perform a body form when the value is truthy
  or when it is falsey.
  Takes a vector pairing a variable name to a value and at least a body form to
  evaluate if the value is truthy, or another body form if value is falsey.
  Returns the return value of the body form that was evaulated.

  Example:
  (if-let [x 5]
    (hs.alert \"I fire because 5 is a truthy value\")
    (hs.alert \"I do not fire because 5 was truthy.\"))
  "
  (assert body1 "expected body")
  `(let [,var-name ,value]
     (if ,var-name
       ,body1
       ,...)))

(fn time
  [body1 ...]
  "
  Macro to time the execution of code
  Takes multiple body forms
  - Evaluates the results once
  - Prints the time in seconds
  Returns the evaluation result

  Example:
  (time (add-monitor-items menu))
  ;; =>
  \"Executed in 3.44445559689e-05 seconds\"
  menu
  "
  (assert body1 "expected body")
  `(let [start# (os.clock)
         results# (do ,body1 ,...)
         end# (os.clock)
         diff# (- end# start#)]
     (print "Executed in" diff# " seconds.")
     results#))
